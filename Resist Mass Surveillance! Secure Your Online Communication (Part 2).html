<i>Disclaimer: </i><i>Never completely rely on any technology in life threatening circumstances. The following tools can be useful in many situations, but they are not completely foolproof. To give an extreme example, there's no point encrypting your hard drive with a super long password if you're going to be physically assaulted until you reveal it. Be safe, be careful and know what you're up against. This approach is called <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/threat-model" target="_blank">Threat Modelling</a>. </i>

Security is a process, not a product.

<strong>Use a VPN</strong>

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">Virtual Private Network</a> will tunnel your web traffic from one location to another using a secure "tunnel". Traditionally this was used to allow employees to connect to a corporate network from their homes. Now there is a booming industry of VPN providers who for a low price will provide you access to their servers around the world to tunnel your web traffic through.

A VPN can provide you a certain degree of protection from anyone trying to surveil your traffic. It could be useful to stop your Internet Service Provider (e.g. BT, Virgin Media, AT&amp;T) from monitoring your traffic or protect your information from malicious hackers poking around on a coffee shop's public WiFi network.

This works because of the tunnel is secured by strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>. Anyone who's try to examine the traffic from your device on your local network will only be able to see that you are making an encrypted connection to a providers VPN server rather than what sites you're visiting.

It is also more difficult (but not totally impossible) for anyone surveilling the provider's VPN server to discover your location. This means that you can connect to a website without that server knowing your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP Address</a>, which gives reveals your approximate location. The server will instead only see the IP Address of the VPN server.

However, you need to be aware that using a commercial VPN requires you to place trust in that service's provider who are potentially able to log your real IP address and traffic and which once stored, could potentially be obtained by law enforcement agencies. These guides may help you choose a service:

<strong>PGP/GPG Email
</strong>

You may often hear about PGP (the underlying software is known as GPG) which is a type of encryption often used in conjunction with email. Although versatile and robust, we believe this method of encrypting your email communications is pretty difficult to use and easy to make critical mistakes with. Consequently, it should only be approached by determined users.

The easiest way of using GPG encryption with your email is  either by using the email client <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/">Enigmail</a> plugin or if you're stuck using webmail in your browser <a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/">Mailvelope</a>. In our opinion, GPG is more useful for other tasks such as verifying downloaded software and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">web of trust</a> workflows.

<em>Note: The Tor network relies on volunteers to run relay nodes. It's capacity and speed have increased dramatically over the years as more and more individuals and organisations contribute.

<strong>Tails</strong>

Tails is a live Linux distribution (meaning it runs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> does not require installation) commonly booted from a USB stick, SD card or DVD that provides a computing environment designed with the utmost security and privacy in mind. It comes preinstalled with a selection of useful software and ALL outgoing web traffic is routed through the Tor anonymity network.

Though this is a relatively advanced tool, Tails is as good as it gets when it comes to privacy enhancing software and is used by thousands around the world including journalists, activists and people just like you.

<strong>Signal Private Messenger</strong>
Signal (formally known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_%28software%29">TextSecure</a>) represents one of the most effectively implemented and easy to use end to end encrypted communication applications<span class=""> available</span><span class=""> today. It provides end to end encrypted messages and calls over WiFi and Mobile Data, allowing you to communicate with anyone around the world and be assured that no one else apart from the intended recipient can read your messages.</span>

You can get set up on Signal in under a couple of minutes and it can be downloaded on the Google Play Store and iOS App Store, search for "Signal Private messenger". Unlike other messaging apps that purport to be private such as Telegram, Signal's code is open source and has subsequently been audited by leading security experts. This is known a privacy by design and not privacy by policy.

You probably won't need any help using Signal, how to guides are available:

<em>Note: The official Android version of Signal currently requires proprietary Google Play services to be installed on the phone as it relies on Google Cloud Messaging. The iOS version uses Apple's proprietary equivalent.

<strong>Cyanogen Mod/Lineage OS
</strong>

CyanogenMod is an after market software for a number of cell phones based on the the Android Open Source Project. It offers features not found in the official Android based operating systems by vendors such as Samsung or Sony but has to be loaded onto your phone manually using a well documented yet somewhat technical process.

Sadly, the Cyanogen Mod project had to shut down in 2016 and is in the process of being replaced by a community driven alternative called Lineage OS. It appears it will be a few months before system images are released.
