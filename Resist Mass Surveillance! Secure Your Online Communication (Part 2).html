<p>It seems that we are all vulnerable in the online world. It could be the threat from the security services of nation states or an unethical corporation seeking to collect all of your private data for various nefarious and undemocratic purposes. It could be a LGBT+ person trying to protect the communications of their community from a repressive regime that could see them put in prison (or worse). It could be the Trans* person, afraid of being thrown out onto the streets if their parents discovered their true gender identity. It could also be a sex worker, looking to protect their non work identity from sexual predators. There are many reasons we require privacy.</p>
<p>Many people choose to put a lock upon the door of their house, install curtains on their windows and wear clothes on their body (at least in public). Why do people choose to do these things? Because those choices empower us to have agency and reveal only what we consent to be revealed. Privacy is a fundamental human right and is a necessary component of democracy, free speech and personal freedom. There is no such thing as "digital" or "online" rights, only human rights.</p>
<p>The current situation online is becoming ever more bleak with the extensive commercialisation and militarisation of the internet. We are all under surveillance online from either government, criminal or corporate entities and those from a gender/sexuality minority are especially vulnerable. However, there are direct actions you can take right now to protect your privacy and the privacy of those you care for.</p>
<p>Queerzone3000 encourages you to get involved in the struggle for a free, open and secure internet in anyway you can. Whether it be through participation in a democratic process or by supporting and developing free and open source software or simply helping people in your community learn to use technology that respects their freedom.</p>
<p><i>Disclaimer: </i><i>Never completely rely on any technology in life threatening circumstances. The following tools can be useful in many situations, but they are not completely foolproof. To give an extreme example, there's no point encrypting your hard drive with a super long password if you're going to be physically assaulted until you reveal it. Be safe, be careful and know what you're up against. This approach is called <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/introduction-threat-modeling" target="_blank">Threat Modelling.</a></i></p>

<p><b>Encrypt all the things!</b></p>

<p>What is encryption?<p>

<p>Encryption is strong maths that can be used to scramble digital information so that nobody can make sense of it apart from those who you allow to. This maths is called cryptography and often abbreviated to simply "crypto". The best cryptography out there is well audited, open source and standardized. This sort of programming is very complex and the homemade crypto someone cooked up in their basement isn't going to protect you.</p>

<p>The most ubiquitous form of encryption is HTTPS, which is commonly used to secure the connection between your computer and a web server on the internet. You know you're using HTTPS (an encrypted version of the HTTP web protocol) when there the URL in your address bar displays an address as https://example.com as opposed to http://example.com. When HTTPS is enabled, you can be reasonably sure that the site you are accessing is who they say they are and that the connection between your browser and the server where the website is hosted is secure. This secure connection is often also indicated by a green padlock</p>

<p><strong>PGP/GPG</strong></p>

<p>You may often hear about PGP (also confusingly known as GPG) which is a type of  encryption often used in conjunction with email. Although versatile and robust, we believe this method of encrypting your communications is pretty difficult to use and easy to make critical mistakes with. Consequently, it should only be approached by determined users. Check out these guides for more info:</p>

<p><strong>Tails</strong></p>

<p>Tails is a live Linux distribution (meaning it runs in RAM does not require installation) commonly booted from a USB stick or SD card that provides a computing environment designed with the utmost security and privacy in mind. It comes pre-installed with a selection of useful software and ALL web traffic is routed through the Tor anonymity network.</p>

<p>Though this is a relatively advanced tool, Tails is as good as it gets when it comes to privacy enhancing software and is used by thousands around the world including journalists, activists and people just like you.</p>

<p><b>Mobile Security</b></p>

<p>A tracking device that also makes phone calls?</p>

<p><strong>Signal Private Messenger</strong></p>
<p>Signal represents one of the most effectively implemented and easy to use end to end encrypted communication applications available today. It provides end to end encrypted messages and calls over WiFi and Mobile Data, allowing you to communicate with anyone around the world and be assured that no one else apart from the intended recipient can read your messages.

<p>You can get set up on Signal in under a couple of minutes and it can be downloaded on the Google Play Store and iOS App Store. Search for "Signal Private messenger". Unlike other messaging apps that purport to be private such as the proprietary WhatsApp, Signal is non profit and its code is open to anyone and has subsequently been audited by leading security experts. This is known a privacy by design and not privacy by policy (such as we see with WhatsApp).</p>
<p><em>Note: Ironically WhatsApp has made moves to implement the TextSecure encryption protocol behind Signal into their application. Queerzone3000 cannot recommend WhatsApp as it is not open source. Assume that if you're using WhatsApp, your messages can potentially be read by a third party (e.g. if Facebook received a court order). </em></p>
<p>Though you probably won't need any help, how to guides are available:</p>
<p>https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-signal-ios</p>
<p>https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-signal-android</p>

<p><em>Note: The official Android version of Signal currently requires proprietary Google Play services to be installed on the phone as it relies on Google Cloud Messaging. The iOS version uses Apple's proprietary equivalent.</em></p>

<strong>Cyanogen Mod</strong>

CyanogenMod is an after market firmware for a number of mobiles phones based on the open-source Android operating system. It offers features not found in the official Android based firmwares of vendors.
